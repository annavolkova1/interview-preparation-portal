## First Web Application Project 
Planned duration: ~ 3 weeks  
General project requirements:  
• Layered and MVC architecture patterns  
• Data should be stored in DB  
• Follow all naming conventions and keep project well-structured  
• Avoid structured programming style  
• Try to use different GoF Patterns (optional)  
• Unit tests  
• VCS (Git recommended)  
• Agile  
• Use Flyway for DB migration control  
## Functional requirements:
**The application provides an opportunity for students to register for a pre-interview:**  
• Choosing a date by interviewers on the calendar  
• Interaction with TEAMS api  
• You should use some older technologies.  
The reason is that usually using of only new technologies doesn’t give deep understating of what are you exactly doing.
For example, you should NOT use Spring ‘magic tools’ like Boot, Data etc., which configures almost everything for you.
Technologies:JDBC, Servlets/JSP, Tomcat, Java 1.7, Gradle
